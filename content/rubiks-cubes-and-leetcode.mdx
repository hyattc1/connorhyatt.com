## TL;DR

As someone who's gone spent a decade solving Rubik's Cubes before ever opening LeetCode, I was surprised to see they both share the same core challenge: seemingly impossible at first, but manageable through pattern recognition and algorithmic thinking. Both require breaking a big problem into small steps and building a toolbox of repeatable patterns to reuse across similar cases.

## ðŸ”¨ Breaking Down the Impossible

Trying to solve a Rubik's cube for the first time is as humbling as it gets. I remember being a toddler messing with one in my grandma's house, unable to complete even one side of it. You might keep twisting hoping for a lucky break, but with over 43 quintillion possible states, brute force won't help. A new coding problem hits the same way: overwhelming at first glance, but manageable once you split it into steps and use the right algorithm. In cubing, you don't memorize every solution â€” you learn patterns that can be reused across situations. Programming is the same: once you recognize a problem type, you pull out a proven approach and adapt it.


## ðŸ§© Pattern Recognition

Both Rubik's cubes and LeetCode problems center around **pattern recognition**. 

In speedcubing, you learn to recognize specific cube states and apply the corresponding algorithms. Here are some beginner level examples which are used in solving the last layer:

<table className="w-full my-6" style={{ borderCollapse: 'collapse', border: '2px solid #374151' }}>
  <tbody>
    <tr style={{ borderBottom: '2px solid #374151', height: '120px' }}>
      <td className="w-32" style={{ borderRight: '2px solid #374151', textAlign: 'center', padding: '16px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}>
        <img 
          src="/sune.png" 
          alt="Sune case"
          className="rounded"
          style={{ width: '80px', height: '80px', objectFit: 'cover', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
        />
      </td>
      <td style={{ padding: '16px 16px 16px 32px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold m-0">Sune</h3>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 m-0">R U R' U R U2 R'</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr style={{ borderBottom: '2px solid #374151', height: '120px' }}>
      <td className="w-32" style={{ borderRight: '2px solid #374151', textAlign: 'center', padding: '16px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}>
        <img 
          src="/pi.png" 
          alt="Pi case"
          className="rounded"
          style={{ width: '80px', height: '80px', objectFit: 'cover', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
        />
      </td>
      <td style={{ padding: '16px 16px 16px 32px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold m-0">Pi</h3>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 m-0">R U2 R' U' R U' R'</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr style={{ height: '120px' }}>
      <td className="w-32" style={{ borderRight: '2px solid #374151', textAlign: 'center', padding: '16px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}>
        <img 
          src="/headlights.png" 
          alt="Headlights case"
          className="rounded"
          style={{ width: '80px', height: '80px', objectFit: 'cover', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
        />
      </td>
      <td style={{ padding: '16px 16px 16px 32px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold m-0">Headlights</h3>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 m-0">R U R' U' R' F R F'</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

In LeetCode, itâ€™s also about seeing patterns: two pointers, sliding window, dynamic programming. Once you know the type, you can grab the right approach.
The key insight is that both activities train your brain to quickly categorize problems and grab the right algorithm that fits.

## âš¡ Muscle Memory

Speedcubers develop muscle memory for algorithms - their fingers move automatically when they recognize a pattern. Similarly, experienced programmers develop "code memory" where they can quickly implement common patterns without thinking about the syntax.

Both skills require:
- **Repetition** to build familiarity
- **Practice** to maintain speed
- **Drilling patterns** until recognition becomes instant

## ðŸŽ¯ Optimization Mindset

In both cubing and coding, solving is only the beginning; the real challenge is chasing a better, more efficient solution.

- **Rubik's Cube**: Finding the most efficient solution path, reducing move count
- **LeetCode**: Optimizing time and space complexity, finding the most elegant solution

The mindset carries over: donâ€™t settle for a solution until itâ€™s sharp, efficient, and resilient.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

If you're interested in either, here are some resources:

### Rubik's Cube
- Start with the **beginner's method**. YouTube tutorials are great.
- Practice with a specialized cubing **timer app**, or grab a StackMat.
- Learn **CFOP method** for speedcubing. It splits the solve into four digestible stages: **C**ross, **F**irst Two Layers, Last Layer **O**rientation, and Last Layer **P**ermutation.

### LeetCode
- Begin with **easy problems**. Focus on studying the solutions more than writing code to build an understanding of how different approaches work.
- Focus on **one pattern** at a time
- Use **<a href="https://leetcode.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leetcode.com</a>** for practice. I usually aim to solve one new problem each day.

The problem-solving patterns from cubing and coding carry over into many parts of my life. If youâ€™ve tried either, what lessons stuck with you?

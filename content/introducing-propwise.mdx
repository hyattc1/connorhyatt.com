Hey there! I’m excited to share one of my recent side projects: **Propwise**, a Chrome extension for real estate risk analysis.  

Propwise brings **investment insights directly into Zillow and Redfin listings** — crime rates, demographics, rental potential, and financial viability — all in one place, without leaving the property page.  

👉 **Live here:** [Propwise Extension](https://github.com/hyattc1/Real-Estate-Risk-Analysis) (coming very soon)  
👨‍💻 **Source code:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hyattc1/Real-Estate-Risk-Analysis)

## 🧩 Challenges & Highlights

### 🕵️‍♂️ Handling Real Estate Data  
Real estate data is fragmented and inconsistent. I built processing pipelines with fallback mechanisms to standardize property details, ensuring accurate analysis.  

### ⚙️ Extension Development  
Developing a Chrome extension meant coordinating multiple layers: the popup UI, content scripts for scraping, API integrations, and a smooth UX.  

### ⚡ Making Analysis Accessible  
The biggest focus was usability — delivering complex data as clear, actionable insights through instant analysis and visual breakdowns.
